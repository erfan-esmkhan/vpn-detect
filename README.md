# vpn detector

A simple project using `react-vpn-detector` to check if a user is connected via VPN.

## Features

- Detect VPN usage.
- Easy to use.
- Lightweight.

## Getting Started & Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/erfan-esmkhan/vpn-detect
   ```

2. Go to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd vpn-detect
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works

`react-vpn-detector` checks the user's IP address and matches it with known VPN providers. The `useVpnDetector` hook returns `true` if a VPN is detected, otherwise `false`.
